The Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display various
debug information about the current request/response and when clicked, display
more details about the panel's content.

Here's a screenshot of the toolbar in action:

In addition to the built-in panels, a number of third-party panels are
contributed by the community.

The current version of the Debug Toolbar is 0.9.4. It works on Django 1.3 and
1.4.

The next version will work on Django 1.4 (1.4.2 or later) and 1.5. In
addition, it will require Python 2.6 or later.

Documentation, including installation and configuration instructions, is
available at http://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.org/.

The Django Debug Toolbar is released under the BSD license, like Django
itself. If you like it, please consider contributing!
